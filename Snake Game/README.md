# Basic Snake Game
This is a very basic snake game with given skeleton on which i had to extend a bit.
I wrote some methods, some classes and interfaces in audition to make the game work like this.
I worked on a given description with guides.

# Game Description
In order to start playing you should choose a difficulty level.
The higher the level, the faster the snake becomes after eating a food.
Then the game begins. Easy rules. You should eat some food (characters from ascii and utf-8 tables) which appears randomly. When you eat you grow.
If you hit a wall you die. If you hit yourself you die. When you die you are asked if you want to try again. Answers are with 'y' and 'n': yes and no accordingly.

# Have fun!
