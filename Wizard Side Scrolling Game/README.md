# Basic Side-Scrolling Game
 
This is a very basic side-scrolling game. I worked on a given description with guides and images from a workshop on SoftUni.
I changed some of the given images so it looks better. Added some additional functionalities like the killed bugs counter, increasing game speed, shooting rate and more.

# Game Description
The objectives of the game are to kill as much bugs as you can before you get hit by one.
To start the game the player should click on the "Press to play" button.
The points start counting as you fly because it means you survived not being hit by e bug.
You can fly around with the arrow keys, but there is gravitation, so it will always pull you back to the ground.
You are a wizard now, so it means you can cast a spell. In order to do it you have to press "space". That's how you kill bugs.
Every killed bug gives you 2000 points. But for every 5 killed bugs the game speed increases.
On the top of the screen, you can see your points and the count of the killed bugs.
Although if you get hit you will have to reload the page and start again.
The most important thing is: HAVE FUN!
